## A Template-based SQL to Text System

This is a template-based SQL to text program for the baseline of result explanation as well as some other projects of text to SQL summer project.

### Usage
1. Unzip [Spider dataset](https://github.com/ryanzhumich/editsql/tree/master/data/spider) and put it in ```./data``` (or use the dataset in other path and change the parameters).
2. Run ```python generate_template.py``` to generate sql templates (current version contains 184 different templates) . 
3. Run ```python better_baseline.py``` to convert query and table directly into natural language text.
4. Results can be found in "./data/better_on_spider_train.txt" where 'restored' is the recovered question generated by the system and 'original' is the question written in the spider training set. It's worth noting that "not finish" means that this template has not been labeled. However "errors" should not be found in the console.

### Requirements
- python >= 3.5
- nltk = 3.5
